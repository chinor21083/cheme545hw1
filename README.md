#The first python file is extract_parameter. This function has the unit_operations_data dictionary. I access the right value in the dictionary by using the brackets. This function returns a string of unit_name+parameter name and the parameter

#The calculate solution weights takes in the molecular weights dataset and the solutions_needed. I use a for loop to loop through all elements of the solutions_needed list, split the string using the '-' delimiter, and use the extract key to get the right value from the dataset. I calculate the grams needed, and the functionr eturns the solution + grams needed
